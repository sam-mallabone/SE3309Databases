For this project, we do not have a src folder in this repository because our client was created
using Angular 4. Our source folder is in the repository named se3309frontendclient and it 
can be found at the link: https://github.com/sam-mallabone/se3309frontendclient. I invited
all the TA's to be contributors to this repository so they should be able to access it and clone
it to get the source code.

All Queries can be found in the server.js file.
